# UTPB-COSC-4470-Project2

This repository contains resources and documentation related to **Project 2** for the **Applied Network Security (COSC-4470)** course at UTPB.  

## 🚀 Project Goals:
- Gain experience performing a comprehensive risk assessment.
- Collaborate effectively in group settings to identify problems and brainstorm practical solutions.
- Understand and apply asset valuations and cost-benefit analysis to mitigate risk efficiently.

## 📄 Project Description:
Each group has been assigned a subnet within a hypothetical medium-sized tech organization. The project involves conducting an extensive risk assessment on the allocated subnet, which includes payroll and web servers, employee workstations, and network peripherals. The team is expected to:
- Identify vulnerabilities and threats.
- Develop and propose effective mitigation strategies.
- Provide cost estimations and perform a cost-benefit analysis for each mitigation strategy.

## 🗂️ Repository Contents:
- **Group2RiskAssement.pdf** – Complete Risk Assessment Report by our group detailing vulnerabilities, mitigation strategies, and cost analyses.

## 📚 Risk Assessment Overview:
Our team conducted an exhaustive risk assessment focusing on critical infrastructure components, identifying significant cyber threats such as ransomware, SQL injection attacks, DDoS, accidental data exposure, and hardware failures.

We’ve provided detailed asset valuations, calculated operational impacts, developed a comprehensive risk matrix prioritizing risks, and outlined phased mitigation strategies including:
- **Critical Infrastructure Protection:** Redundant server implementation, enhanced firewalls, and air-gapped backup solutions.
- **Authentication & Access Control:** Multi-factor authentication and privileged access management.
- **Human Factors:** Security awareness training, phishing simulations, and incident response planning.

## 💡 Key Findings:
- Critical risks involve ransomware threats, insufficient backups, weak authentication controls, and limited staff security awareness.
- The cost of potential security incidents vastly exceeds the investment required for implementing recommended mitigation strategies.
- Estimated potential direct loss from a severe security incident exceeds **$250,000**, whereas our recommended security strategy requires an investment between **$75,000 and $125,000** over 12 months, indicating a strong return on investment (ROI).

## 🛠️ Implementation Roadmap:
- **Phase 1 (0-3 Months):** Immediate implementation of multi-factor authentication, automated patch management, initial security training, firewall enhancement, and backup procedures.
- **Phase 2 (3-6 Months):** Advanced security implementations including a SIEM solution, privileged access management, penetration testing, formal incident response, and DDoS mitigation.
- **Phase 3 (6-12 Months):** Strategic long-term solutions such as zero-trust architectures, compliance monitoring, disaster recovery, and enhanced API security.

## 📈 ROI Analysis:
The investment provides a highly favorable ROI of **3:1 to 7:1**, significantly reducing both direct financial losses and intangible costs like reputational damage and operational disruption.
